# Level: Adept

Now we're getting serious. Hope you did as many exercises as you could, because
we're reaching a level that is high enough to compare to most books.

From here, you should be able to follow other books too to reinforce this 
learning. 

We will push in this stage basically from zero to 100. I'll get you into a
minimal base, so you will be able to do useful programs after this part.

Magic? Arcane? Not anymore. We'll get understanding on most concepts in 
programming, so they will stop sounding like black magic.

Let's use libraries and create programs that perfectly could run
in a production environment.

> NOTE: It's possible that I'm pushing this section too far. I'm aware that I am
covering too much ground here. Depending on how this plays out I might split
this into two.
