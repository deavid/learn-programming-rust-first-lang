# Level: Apprentice

Now your spells are quite powerful already, and they loop around and do some
logic. This, as you have seen, creates full programs that start to make sense
and are beginning to be useful.

In this phase of learning you're going to learn what is needed to finally
make useful programs. From here your programs would be good enough that you'll
be able to make your own utilities for yourself.

The code might not be pretty, but you'll have enough tools to do a lot of
interesting stuff.

You can consider this chapter to be learning your first fireball spell. 
Rough, but powerful and effective.
