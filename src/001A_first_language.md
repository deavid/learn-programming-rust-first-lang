# Your first programming language

This is a common question everyone asks themselves. 
In my opinion, Python and Rust are the two best languages to start with. 
While Python will give you an easier time to begin, and plenty of jobs that
actually exist, Rust is going to be a bit harder to begin with, with way less jobs.

As the title suggests, I'm going to recommend Rust. Why? Lots of reasons. 
I believe Rust will be the language of the future, so by the time you learn it 
hopefully there will be jobs waiting for you.

Rust also will teach you proper coding practices. As it is stricter, it will 
force you into the right shape and mindset for a programmer, and not someone who 
stitches things together that delivers delicate programs that break in strange 
ways just by looking at them.

The Rust community is very friendly. You'll have a lot of people wanting to 
teach you the language and help you along on this. Python is a bit of 
hit-and-miss, some communities might be toxic.

The documentation is solid, nicely written, and very easy to follow. 
The reference docs might be a bit complex to understand at first, but 
after the first month or two it becomes very practical.

Rust has potential to be used for anything. Web, games, embedded devices, 
operating systems, browsers, you name it. There are still several gaps 
at the moment of this writing due to the nature of Rust being so new; over time 
more libraries will be created and mature, so right now there are several 
types of applications where Rust might not be fit. For now.

Python is very powerful and is able to do most of the applications that you 
might want to do, and it is very quick to write and get results with it. But it 
has several downsides (one is performance) that are very unlikely to disappear 
in the next 10 or 20 years[^1].

In the end, it doesn't matter that much which language you start with. As long 
as you can learn to code, the language isn't that important. All languages have 
lots of similarities, so much that when you learn the second one it will take 
99% less time than the first.

And you can't count on learning a single language (i.e. Rust) and hope that this 
would be all. There are always languages that are very good at one thing, and 
you should learn those too. Because you don't want to spend a week doing 
something in Rust that takes 1 line of Bash to do, if there's no real reason or 
benefit[^2] for it.

So, no worries, you'll be fine. You'll learn other languages over the course of 
years and that will take less and less time as you go.

[^1]: As usual, there are several companies trying to make Python faster. Some
efforts are going through "compiling" typed python code with great speedups. 
There's also PyPy. But the community at this point does not want a "typed Python"
so I don't see the performance being fixed in the near future.

[^2]: I've seen someone write a full Java application for several days, trying
to make it as fast as possible, and someone else came up with a Bash one liner
with pipes that did the same thing 2x faster, and they basically spent 5 minutes
writing the line. Use the best tool for each job. You should learn more than one 
programming language.
