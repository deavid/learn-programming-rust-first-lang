# Project: A simple game with ggez

Now that we know a bit about structs, enums and similar stuff, we're ready for
our next game.

As expected, we will change the game engine to something more appropriate: ggez

<https://crates.io/crates/ggez>

In comparison with Macroquad that we have seen before, this one uses structs. 
Because of this we can organize our code much better and make a game that can 
grow in features without getting too convoluted.
