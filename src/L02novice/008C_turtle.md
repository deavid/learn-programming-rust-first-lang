# Let's try Turtle!

For learning purposes, there was a little program called `turtle` in the 80s for
a programming language called LOGO.

This was intended for kids to learn coding. It displayed a little turtle, and
they could send commands such as:

* Move right 30 pixels.
* Move top 30 pixels.
* Move left 30 pixels.
* Move bottom 30 pixels.

And that would create a rectangle on screen.

This is fascinating for learning because there is a visual feedback on the 
screen. And let's face it, the console is booooring.

In Rust, there's a library for this and I think it's worth exploring.

If it doesn't work for you, or if you prefer console, just move on. I'll have
examples for everything in the console.

The library is this one: <https://crates.io/crates/turtle>

What we should do now is add this library as a dependency to our `Cargo.toml`
like this:

```toml
[dependencies]
turtle = { git = "https://github.com/sunjay/turtle.git", tag = "v1.0.0-rc.2" }
```

We just need to add the line[^1] 
`turtle = { git = "https://github.com/sunjay/turtle.git", tag = "v1.0.0-rc.2" }` 
at the end of the file, just below `[dependencies]`.

**BEFORE GOING FURTHER:** Please verify this does work for you. Run `cargo build`
on the terminal and ensure that there are no errors.

Here's what happens on my computer after running this the first time:

If we run it again, it will be much shorter. This is correct:
```
$ cargo build
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.03s
```

[^1]: I had to use the Git repository and the tag `v1.0.0-rc.2` because 
`v1.0.0-rc.3` which is the latest one crashes for me, and just specifying the
RC version doesn't seem to be something that Cargo likes for this package.

# Testing Turtle

Let's begin by creating a file `turtle_vars.rs` in `learnrust/src/bin/` and
place the following example code inside:

```rust
use turtle::Turtle;

fn main() {
    let mut turtle = Turtle::new();

    turtle.forward(10.0);
}
```

Now, remember that we have to add this program into `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[[bin]]
name = "turtle_vars"
```

And now, let's test this:

```console
$ cargo run --bin turtle_vars
```

This should display a window like this:

![Small arrow up](../img/turtle_vars_01.png)

If this is what you see, congrats! It works for you!

# Drawing a rectangle

As explained at the beginning, we just need a few commands to do this.

Basically, we can tell the turtle to turn right while moving, and if done
in four steps, we should get a rectangle:

```rust
    turtle.forward(100.0);
    turtle.right(90.0);
    turtle.forward(100.0);
    turtle.right(90.0);
    turtle.forward(100.0);
    turtle.right(90.0);
    turtle.forward(100.0);
```

And this gives us a nice animation. The end result is:

![Square](../img/turtle_vars_02.png)

But wait! What does `100.0` mean? And `90.0`?

The first one is the distance to move, the second one is the angle to turn.

So the program really says:

* Walk forward 100 pixels.
* Turn right 90 degrees.
* Now walk forward again 100 pixels.
* Turn right again 90 degrees.
* Walk again 100 pixels.
* Right by 90 degrees.
* Walk 100 pixels.

But to someone reading the program it might be confusing to understand.

Also, what if we want to make the rectangle bigger or smaller? We would need
to change the `100.0` in all four places. That's a lot of work!![^2]

So let's use variables to prevent repetition:

```rust
    let distance = 100.0;
    let angle = 90.0;

    turtle.forward(distance);
    turtle.right(angle);
    turtle.forward(distance);
    turtle.right(angle);
    turtle.forward(distance);
    turtle.right(angle);
    turtle.forward(distance);
```

Nice! Now if we want to make it bigger we just change:

```rust
    let distance = 200.0;
    let angle = 90.0;
```

But what happens if we change the angle? Let's try it out!

```rust
    let distance = 200.0;
    let angle = 120.0;
```

![Triangle](../img/turtle_vars_03.png)

It draws a triangle! Wait, what?!

That's because a regular polygon has their sides separated by an angle defined by:

\\[angle = 360 / sides \\]

And \\(360/3=120\\), so 120 degrees is just a triangle.

Wait a secondâ€¦ can we make this, so it can do different polygons?

Sure! First we copy the `forward` and `right` commands a few times more:

```rust
    let distance = 200.0;
    let angle = 120.0;

    turtle.forward(distance);
    turtle.right(angle);
    turtle.forward(distance);
    turtle.right(angle);
    turtle.forward(distance);
    turtle.right(angle);
    turtle.forward(distance);
    turtle.right(angle);
    turtle.forward(distance);
    turtle.right(angle);
    turtle.forward(distance);
    turtle.right(angle);
    turtle.forward(distance);
    turtle.right(angle);
    turtle.forward(distance);
    turtle.right(angle);
    turtle.forward(distance);
```

Now we can compute the angle by using the formula:

```rust
    let sides = 5.0;
    let distance = 200.0;
    let angle = 360.0 / sides;
```

And we get a new figure:

![Pentagon](../img/turtle_vars_04.png)

Try playing yourself with the values and see what happens each time. 

* What happens if we put `sides = 10.0` and `distance = 50.0`? Why?
* What happens if we change `angle = 300.0` and `sides = 8.0`?
* And `angle = 315.0` and `sides = 5.0`?

-----------
[^2]: Yes, we programmers are lazy. How could you have guessed that?

## That's it!

Well done. Hope you enjoyed this.

Yes, there's still a lot of repetition in the code, 
but well get to that very soon.

Here's the full program:

```rust
{{#include ../../learnrust/src/bin/turtle_vars.rs}}
```
