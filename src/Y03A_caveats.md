# Appendix B. Caveats and challenges in this book

This book is intended to people with no previous experience in coding at all 
and attempts to teach programming in a very approachable way.

Because of this, a lot of information is hidden, misrepresented or 
factually incorrect. It is needed to hide and oversimplify stuff, so new 
learners don't get overloaded with information. This also helps the reader 
to create their own programs very early on without needing 
to have a proper understanding, which can come in later on.

Other books might put a lot of theory in front to give a good understanding 
of what is coming next, but theory is indeed boring until it's put into use, 
so in this book I try to push down the theory as far as possible.

If this approach is good or bad it's certainly subjective. But as everyone else 
goes for a more academic way, and there is almost no one that does something 
like I do in this book, I think it's good to add more choices for learning.
