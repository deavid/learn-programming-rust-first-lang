## The holy Rust book

You must know that there exists a book called just "The Rust book" or "the book". 

I will (jokingly & friendly) call it here "The holy rust book". 

You can check it here:
<https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/>

The holy book is the main learning resource for Rust. 
It is the true starting point for learning the language and contains 
everything, from beginner to truly advanced. 
It covers the entire language (except the uses of Unsafe, that are covered in 
the Necronomicon... I mean, the Rustonomicon)

This guide is not meant to replace the holy book itself, as it is very well 
written by experts and reviewed by the whole community. 

If that's the case, what's the point of this then? Well, the holy book assumes 
some knowledge. It will rapidly grow in difficulty and will require several 
reads for beginners and look in other places as well to fully grasp the concepts.

Only a small part of the language will be covered here; enough to get you started, 
and at a slow pace enough to follow without external resources (hopefully). 
From time to time I'll link to the holy book, so you can go there to read if you 
like, as there's more detail.

I call it "holy" because it's the Rust Bible (in fact some people call it that). 
If the holy book disagrees with me, the book is right, I'm wrong. 
Whatever it says, it is right. 
A lot of people call Rust a cult (seriously) so I pretend to extend and embrace 
the term to make it a funny joke.
